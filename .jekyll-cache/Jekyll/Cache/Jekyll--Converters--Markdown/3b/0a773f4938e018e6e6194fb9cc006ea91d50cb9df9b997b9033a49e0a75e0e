  <li>I transitioned to being fun-employed, giving me a ton more time to work on whatever I wanted to.\</li>
  <li>Jessâ€™s mum and aunt n uncle came to town, so that was fun.</li>
</ul>

<p>I visited the part of town I used to live in, and crossed the Lachine Canal by foot, and snuck into the VanGogh â€˜heavenâ€™ room.<br />
<em> Lots of equalization payment jokes.</em></p>

<p>I turned 10,000 days old on New Years. Pretty proud of that one.<br />
I grok file systems a lot better than I used to, and configuring things no longer leads  me to immediate panic/withdrawl.<br />
I started AdventOfCode. Which (writing this in February) seems ridiculous, with how much Iâ€™ve grown, and more importantly, how much I expect from myself. Wow.\</p>
