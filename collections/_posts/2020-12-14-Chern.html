# Midnight in Chernobyl 

### A gigantic read worthy of the Soviet-Promethean gigantomania it portrays.

It reads like science-horror fiction, I was often slack-jawed. It was a good thing I read this while walking, blowing off steam rather than ruminating in the utter helplessness and impossibility of it all. 

Three decades later, over half of the wild boar shot by hunters in the forests of the Czech Republic are still too radioactive for human consumption.

The complete and unceasing botch job of the Soviet government - dropping sand & lead from helicopters for instance.

When Forsmark asked if anybody had happen to fart large amounts of Cesium 137 into the air.
Every time Hans Blix/Hans Brix was mentioned.
The disregard in sending tens of thousands of conscripts to clear debris, exposing them to early deaths. Like the WW2 gunless invasion, which apparently never happened.	
Maria Protsenko’s diligent work ethic and the fact that she is still alive at time of writing.

HBO’s Chernobyl, like virtually all TV adaptations, cut out details and misrepresent the truth. Just be prepared to reconsider who the baddies are. Dyatlov was the most difficult character to put away/judge. Bryukhanov too.

#### Quote

“”Those who understood the threat eventually developed an unconscious habit of picking the tiniest specks of dust off clothes and tabletops—flicking them away in a constant, reflexive process of personal decontamination. But others remained unaware of the invisible dangers around them: soldiers lounged in the sun close to the reactor…Only the fate of the crows that had come to scavenge from the debris but stayed too long—and whose irradiated carcasses now littered the area around the plant—provided any visible warning of the costs of ignorance.””
