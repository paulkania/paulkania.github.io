*Elle regrettait qu’il n’ait pas pris le temps de caresser sa toison pubienne pour déclencher cette étrange onde de plaisir. Mais sa préoccupation immédiate - un progrès, après sa répulsion et sa peur - était de sauver les apparences, sans le décevoir ni s’humilier devant lui, ni lui donner l’impression de s'être trompé en la choisissant parmi toutes les femmes qu’il avait connues. Elle allait surmonter cette épreuve.*



**Review**

Having just finished moments ago, the final developments tower over the rest of the story. The intoxicating and hopeless 'what if?'. Theirs is a story less flagellating than is possible in our age of social media. Edward suffers from nostalgia but he has no option to spy and stalk in moments of weakness. Instead, he ponders old trails shared. Healthier. Siahly joined me for the last few pages of the book which raised my spirits and took me out of a feeling of self-pity and what-ifs one naturally reflects on in a story like this. 

Ian McEwan wrote a great character exposition? **Is this what people call ‘slice-of-life’?** All the characters felt tangible, real, known. Florence, Edward, Violet, Lionel, Geoffrey, coo-coo-mama.
Certainly, if this book were a parable it would teach that communication and biting the bullet early are key to health. Hiding feelings and at least not working through them independently will only lead to neuroticism and more pain. The problem does not go away. Life could have been so different. Had Edward not prematurely ejaculated and allowed Florence more time to understand that she could enjoy sex, which seemed to be a skill she was just beginning to develop. She was uninitiated and terrified which she had every right to be. Before this book, I thought only an ejaculation that resulted in impregnation could really be fatidique, mais il s'avère que l’orgasme précoce pendant la nuit de noce peut être aussi fatidique.
**The hand of God played through the morals of the church.**They were married that day, and so Edward internalized Florence's nuptial duty as a duty presented by Mr. God himself. Without that noble pride, they could have likely come to an agreement on Chesil beach.
I look forward to reading more Ian McEwen, probably Amsterdam next, but next up I'll try Joshua Ferris 'de bonne heure' (aussi Histoire de Pi) because it's a library read so I only have it for a month..which is plenty. Still, it sucks feeling there’s a timeline. I shouldn’t feel a sense of urgency, but it’s my loan in a while, and I’m naturally cautious. I can extend, download, and worst-case, re-pull a book after Montrealer X takes it out of my hands.

**Appendum:** These 'free children’ have no other map. The default hasn't changed **much**, and I ask myself how much my default has changed. With Jess, our relationship was fairly typical, it was essentially Christian, we shared a house, expenses, a bed. she was jealous, I was possessive. I'll never go back to that. Writing this in my room, the master of even this small space is paramount to me. I daydream often about my own apartment. But I worry about a stagnant environment if it were just me. Relationships are a mirror that give you picture that’s clearer. 

**Film Update:** I watched the film hours after I finished the book. Enough was different that the story really no longer remained the same. Superficially it did, but you simply can’t rush intrigue, detail, and the smell of starched bed sheets. The real lives of these people. But the movie tried anyway and the result was a film that came off as pretty eccentric because it tried to capture some details of the book to the letter, while A) changing various plot fundamentals and without B) taking the time that the book spends on character exposition. The film was a strange abomination of the book, but I think the effort was mostly honest. The time given to Edward’s mother was strange, while in the book, it made sense. I’ll never know what watching the film would be like without the book for context, but I imagine I would be pretty confused. Pages and pages of exposition were replaced with frantic glances and half-baked allusions to sexual prudence that never seemed like Florence’s extreme prudence, but rather a prudence of the time. Also who decided to give Florence a hippy epingle for half of the film?

**French Language Experience:** I enjoyed the challenge of navigating the ambiguity of who is talking about whom. Google translate suffers from this, as you’ll see if you translate quote below. 
1. Lui is always used, never elle. 2. Fr -> il a visite *sa* mere. En -> he visited *his* mom.
