###### Langue: Francais 

###### November 6 - 13. Consistent ~60 pages a day. 

###### Medium/High Effort. I wanted to see how fast I could read this book, so I put in work, and was absorbed in nostalgia and re-discovery until my burnout & patchy climax.

#### The book itself

Harry Potter is decidedly un-punk, British, subservient. Rowling obviously had a marketing budget and learned how to peddle escapism to children well. Magic, innocent sexual intrigue, and a universe that doesn’t make you think too hard while still offering a boundless world, a centre-of-the-universe protagonist, clear divisions between good and evil. It was mostly bullshit, but tell that to my nostalgia.

**I loved:** Draco's burns on Ron, Gilderoys sliminess - Is that birthed my hate for Ronaldo? - The discovery of words like moldu, Poudlard, sang-de-bourbe, Jedusor, Nick-Quasi-Sans-Tete. 

Je suis un quoi? Oh im spécial in yet another way? How remarkable.“le choixpeau a laissé tomber un épée sur ma tête, voilà" Harry’s dumb luck gets old. As did Gilderoy Lockhart.

#### Nostalgia, and reaching a tipping point in my French language skill.

Le sommet de la nostalgie se flétrit rapidement. Cela dépend du media. - Les plus éphémères experiences sont liées aux jeux vidéo, puis cinéma. **How does music nostalgia compare to literature nostalgia? Maybe nostalgia in video games depends more on context and experiences shared?** If I played WWE with Reisman today, it would be absurd, but it might also be beautiful? Who knows.
Maybe nostalgia holds stronger roots in story, than in base-building. Taking the exact same steps in a narrative is walking a tighter line than opening up another Orc vs Human campaign, where the choice of how to proceed is far more open.

It was nice to join something comfortable in my past, especially as someone doesn’t have this habit. Revisiting old friends is important, as is not taking myself seriously, allowing myself to read young fiction, even if it is in French. 

I imagine I will read the 6th or 7th Potter as a language exercise one day. A victory lap/comparison to my level of French at this time. **How will the writing in the series progress, as JK acknowledges the growing maturity of her audience? Will the characters convey more dimensionality and moral ambiguity?**
