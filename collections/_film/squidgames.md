I think this show is popular because it rode the wave of parasite.
but it is entirely vapid, and kitsch - it follows a popular aesthetic, without having done anything interesting to add to it, nor to actually say anything itself. I'm deeply dissapointed in how things become popular these days, while i read my stories which actually engross me, and then i'm just asking myself, why is this popular?

it feels like the same reason team sports is popular - people need something to talk about, and netflix can practically inject virality through what really isn't so far off from psyops.
step 1 make show
step 2 sockpuppet and suggest front page
step 3 hopefully it catches
step 4 keep it on front page.

it's so simple, but it works because nobody fucking reads anymore, they just go on netflix to fill their empty lives. it's sad.

i think the timing of masks and the facelessness of 1 year into covid maybe gives people a reason to watch squid games - subconsciously we are looking for answers, and because squid game uses masks so heavily, maybe squid games has an answer or 2 to the world we are living in..but i'll i'm seeing is violence and supposed intrigue.

so bad.
